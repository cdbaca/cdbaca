# Hi, Iâ€™m Chris Baca

I'm a Blackboard Administrator and aspiring Python and SQL developer.

## My primary languages are 
- **Python**, which I have used for:
1. building a local ETL process for data analysis (student class attendance)
2. scripting tasks in Blackboard ([see my bb_assignments repo](https://github.com/cdbaca/bb_assignments))
3. small web development projects (like this static site generator [I'm working on here](https://github.com/cdbaca/ssg), and Django projects for work)
4. automating solutions in the workplace
- **PostgreSQL**, which I have used to:
1. write reports out of our SIS and LMS for data analysis
2. aid in scripting tasks that require Blackboard data
3. contribute to the [Blackboard DDA query repository](https://github.com/cdbaca/Bb-DBQueryRepository)

My interests are varied... on any given day, I am interested in reading philosophy or fiction, listening to old-school or new-school hip hop, working on my house, or learning something new.
