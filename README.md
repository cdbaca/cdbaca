# Hi, Iâ€™m Chris Baca

I'm a Blackboard Administrator and aspiring Python and SQL developer.

## My primary languages are 
- **Python**, which I have used for:
1. scripting tasks in Blackboard
2. small web development projects (currently working on a custom static site generator)
3. automating solutions in the workplace
- **PostgreSQL**, which I have used to:
1. write reports out of our SIS and LMS for data analysis
2. aid in scripting tasks that require Blackboard data
3. contribute to the [Blackboard DDA query repository](https://github.com/cdbaca/Bb-DBQueryRepository)

My interests are varied... on any given day, I am interested in reading philosophy or fiction, listening to old-school or new-school hip hop, working on my house, or learning something new.
