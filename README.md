# Hi, Iâ€™m Chris Baca

I'm a data analyst at a digital marketing agency, and an aspiring Python developer.

## My primary languages are 
- **Python**, which I have used for:
1. ETL and pipelines
2. scripting tasks and automating tasks
3. small web development projects (like this static site generator [I'm working on here](https://github.com/cdbaca/ssg), and Django projects for work)

- **PostgreSQL**, which I have used to:
1. write reports and analyze data
2. ensure accurate data for projects and automation

My interests are varied... on any given day, I am interested in reading philosophy or fiction, listening to old-school or new-school hip hop, working on my house, or learning something technical.
